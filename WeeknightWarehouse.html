<div class=""Section1"">      <p class=""c1""></p>      <p>        Each time I pass through the automatic sliding doors of an        immense hardware warehouse, the gust of stale warm air        rustles my hair to remind me: No other place is as communal        or as incomplete on a weeknight.      </p>      <p>        The mood strikes me first in the parking lot, where only        the slightest electric hum can be distinguished under the        pale fluorescence of tall lampposts.  Only a few insects        dare challenge the silence with their chirps and buzzes and        as I stride toward the entrance, I watch their tiny        silhouettes hover in front of the tremendous backlit        letters hanging above, spelling out the name of the place        minus an ""M"" that has long been burned out.        </p>      <p>        I frequently find myself entering these vast spaces in such        a manner, usually on a mission with or for my father.  His        projects throughout the years have generally focused on        what I consider to be the inane and what he considers the        essential.  We differ on this minor stance, but having been        raised to eat every last pea and to mow the lawn in a        meticulous circuit so as to avoid grass clumping, how can I        neglect my duty as willing hardware apprentice?      </p>      <p>        Thus, I have been to every Lowes and Home Depot in the        tri-state area.  I have spent three hours watching my        father examine a tube of caulk.  I have lugged enough tar        and Quikrete to pave Wisconsin and I have discovered that        hardware stores on weeknights are ghost towns compared to        their alter egos on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.  Full        of mostly lone men in search of peace and quiet as much as        any bracket or screw, there is an unspoken communion from        after dinner until close.      </p>      <p>        There is something oddly solemn about the way men in worn        John Deere hats peruse driveway sealant on Thursday        evenings, as if they were choosing which would be penciled        in to receive the pickup truck in their will.  Valiant        smirks surface above slackened ties when the exact swivel        casters needed are found.  Sometimes the bags under their        eyes are like pillows, each man having worked all day        without the chance to even yawn.  There is no yawning,        however, not in a warehouse.      </p>      <p>        Nothing in a hardware warehouse is whole, nothing complete.         This is why a full yawn could never escape.  Everything is        scheduled to be added, mixed, glued, nailed into place.         The building itself screams work-in-progress, just a giant        box.  Slab concrete floor, vapor barrier exposed ceilings,        stock lighting and a simple chain link fence enclosing the        garden section.  One could not live in this place despite        the fact that it supplies all the necessary ingredients for        building a home.      </p>      <p>        As long as I can remember, this is the way it has been.  In        my father's mind, trips to the hardware warehouse involve a        deep concern for the protection of investments, namely his        home and all things associated.  He shares this sentiment        with the men around him and from this collective point of        view stems the belief that familial love can indeed be        manifested in the upkeep of shared spaces and communal        items.  If a wooden deck is treated and sealed in the        spring for instance, there will be no splinters in the        tender feet of children in the summer, making backyard        barbeques all the more enjoyable for everyone.        </p>      <p>        In my mind, these trips are less pragmatic and seem only to        add color to my growing feeling of inadequacy.  I was never        much for paying attention to my father's lectures on grout        properties and fiberglass insulation.  It all seemed a bit        foolish to me, to obsess over the intricacies of pipe        soldering with so much else going on in the world.         Nonetheless, I have come to understand that the forces that        bind a son to a father are strong and more importantly,        overriding.  No matter how foolish my father's concerns may        seem, I will always place my qualms aside and travel to the        warehouse on my Tuesday and Thursday nights.       </p>      <p>        There an eerie feeling brews within me as I walk down        aisles upon aisles of items for the kitchen, the bedroom,        the places where I eat and sleep.  I stop in the mock        kitchen set-ups and examine the stylized cabinet pulls,        shaped like forks and spoons.  I cannot help but envision        them elsewhere, on white wooden drawers in tropical        locations, in houses of soft pinks and corals, with sofa        cushions upholstered in fish-patterned fabric, jade green        plaster lamps shaped like seashells; places so unlike the        warehouse, places with a view of a turquoise sea.  I do        this for many other items, the bathtubs, the jigsaws, each        ending up in a complete place with purpose and momentum.  I        do this and I visit whole buildings that contain items not        so out of context.  I do this and then I return to the        reality of the warehouse.      </p>      <p>        Of course the paint value center is empty on these        weeknights, lacking its usual Saturday afternoon newlywed        couple, giving me another chance to imagine as I visualize        them looking at chip samples.  She is wearing her new        hiking boots, the ones yet to be scuffed.  What color will        their new kitchen be: Honeydew&hellip;Shire Green&hellip;Mermaid        Isle&hellip;Havana Cream?  He does not seem to care much, nodding        slowly as she flips through the rainbow.  The honeymoon is        gone and the show has begun and he cannot keep his eyes off        the laser level on sale for $49.99 until&hellip;.Honeydew it is.         Years later he will be a weeknight patron like my father.      </p>      <p>        As my eyes trace the steps of the imagined couple toward        the exit, I notice Leonard, who is standing, less than        stoic, at the entrance to the garden center.  Humidity        billows moist and heavy behind him and his crisp red apron.         Leonard's name tag indicates that he is there to help        discuss keeping lawns perfectly green and his back-brace        suggests that he might heft fifty pound fertilizer bags        into a landscaping truck.  Unfortunately, as soon as        Leonard picks at the scab on his nose I realize he probably        is not very good at either.  He is just a kid, the type of        employee my father has taught me to avoid in the search for        assistance.  Rather, I should ask ""HELLO MY NAME IS: PETE""        for help instead, his apron splotched and ripped with age        and knowledge.        </p>      <p>        Men like Pete fit more convincingly into this environment        than I ever will, sharing the space willingly with the        faux-know-it-alls who come seeking advice without wanting        to ask for it; unready to expose their status as sheetrock        neophytes.  All of them hoist tools and implements,        simulating drywall installation techniques and belt-sanding        methods, reveling in the majesty of their own technical        ability.  They scrawl numbers and figures on tiny yellow        lined pads with the nubs of ancient work bench        Ticonderogas.  Their hats often hint at their areas of        expertise: Conklin &amp; Sons Plumbing, Radford Electric,        Smith Siding and Gutter.  Other men are clad in business        attire, fresh from the office, itching to throw on some        mesh shorts, but sacrificing comfort for the solace of        Aisle 14.  They band together in this place, the        well-versed and the rookies, all characters in a mysterious        documentary, each lamenting the hour of reckoning, the call        for last shoppers to report to registers for check-out.         They begin their sad slow waltz hesitantly, finally having        to decide which gauge wire really will do the trick.      </p>      <p>        They hover slowly under the track lighting, gliding like        specters across the cool, cracked concrete floors.  As LCD        screens on clocks readjust their neon line segments to form        a 9, a 4, and a 5, it becomes impossible to imagine that        children in houses are collectively laying their heads on        soft pillows, pulling down shades and drifting to sleep        under down comforters.  In warehouses, sleep is a concept        similar to yawns, yet to be constructed, fought off at all        costs.  Sleep is still some wire (Aisle 3), a shade (Aisle        9), a socket (Aisle 14), and a switch (Aisle 3 again).         Sleep is still ten easy steps away from being whole,        complete, real.  It would prevent patrons entirely from        being able to embrace their role in the warehouse, as        important entities, with specific agendas and projects to        attend even on Friday nights.  Despite all this, however,        each man leaves at home a reality entirely unknown to his        weeknight counterparts.        </p>      <p>        I know my father's reality of course, as I watch him        standing, examining a set of drill bits.  If I was not his        son, I do not know what I would think of him in his ruddy        blue sweatpants.  He lost his reading glasses, the ones he        used to read the labels and mixing procedures on the back        of plastic bottles and burlap sacks.  He wears my mother's        glasses instead.  They rest sloppily on his nose, a trace        of secretary.  From a distance he may look foolish, so        enthralled in the twenty bit set with his ghost white        ankles ending in a pair of weatherworn Topsiders.  He may        look foolish, but he is foolish and concerned.  Foolish and        only a short drive away from home and his bed, where sleep        may become reality and dreams might place him inside the        only house I will ever be capable of building, a house        shaded in soft pinks and corals, constructed without the        hammering of a single nail.        </p>    </div>
